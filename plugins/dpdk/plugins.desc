  # orchestration
  # A plugin can have mutiple components, each component may need to be
  # installed on different inventory or have its own configuration.
  # due to Compass4nfv currently only supports ansible, so each component
  # of the installation and configuration script need to be use ansible.
  # cm : congfiguration management tool : only ansible support
  # role: each component corresponds to ansible script that locates in the same
  # directory as plugin.desc.
  # phrase: pre_openstack -- the component is installed after the OS
  # provisioning, before the OpenStack deployment.
  # phrase: post_openstack -- the component is installed before the OpenStack
  # deployment.
  # inventory: if the phrase is pre_openstack, inventory can be controller and
  # compute. if the phrase is post_openstack, inventory can be get from the file
  # openstack-ansible.inventory
