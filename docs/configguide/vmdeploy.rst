Installation Guide (Virtual Deployment)
=======================================

Nodes Configuration (Virtual Deployment)
----------------------------------------

The below file is the inventory template of deployment nodes:

"./deploy/conf/vm_environment/huawei-virtual1/network.yml"

You can write your own address/roles reference to it.

        - name -- Host name for deployment node after installation.

        - roles -- Components deployed.

**Set TYPE and FLAVOR**

E.g.

.. code-block:: yaml

    TYPE: virtual
    FLAVOR: cluster

**Assignment of different roles to servers**

E.g. Openstack only deployment roles setting

.. code-block:: yaml

    hosts:
      - name: host1
        roles:
          - controller
          - ha

      - name: host2
        roles:
          - compute

NOTE:
IF YOU SELECT MUTIPLE NODES AS CONTROLLER, THE 'ha' role MUST BE SELECT, TOO.

E.g. Openstack and ceph deployment roles setting

.. code-block:: yaml

    hosts:
      - name: host1
        roles:
          - controller
          - ha
          - ceph-adm
          - ceph-mon

      - name: host2
        roles:
          - compute
          - ceph-osd

E.g. Openstack and ODL deployment roles setting

.. code-block:: yaml

    hosts:
      - name: host1
        roles:
          - controller
          - ha
          - odl

      - name: host2
        roles:
          - compute

E.g. Openstack and ONOS deployment roles setting

.. code-block:: yaml

    hosts:
      - name: host1
        roles:
          - controller
          - ha
          - onos

      - name: host2
        roles:
          - compute

Network Configuration (Virtual Deployment)
------------------------------------------

Before deployment, there are some network configuration to be checked based
on your network topology.Compass4nfv network default configuration file is
"compass4nfv/deploy/conf/vm_environment/huawei-virtual1/network.yml".
You can write your own reference to it.

**The following figure shows the default network configuration.**

.. code-block:: console

Start Deployment (Virtual Deployment)
-------------------------------------

1. Edit run.sh

Set OS version and OpenStack version for deployment nodes.
    Compass4nfv Colorado supports three OS version based openstack mitaka.

E.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    ########## Ubuntu14.04 Mitaka ##########
    export OS_VERSION=trusty
    export OPENSTACK_VERSION=mitaka

    ########## Ubuntu16.04 Mitaka ##########
    # export OS_VERSION=xenial
    # export OPENSTACK_VERSION=mitaka_xenial

    ########## Centos7 Mitaka ##########
    # export OS_VERSION=centos7
    # export OPENSTACK_VERSION=mitaka

Set ISO image that you want to deploy

E.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    # ISO_URL is your iso's absolute path
    # export ISO_URL=file:///home/compass/compass4nfv.iso
