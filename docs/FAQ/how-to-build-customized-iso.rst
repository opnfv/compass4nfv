How to build a customized ISO
=============================

If you want to use Compass4nfv official ISO to deploy the environment, you can jump over this section.

This section indicates how to add additional packages and how to build a new compass4nfv ISO file
so that Compass4nfv would install the additional packages automatically during the deployment.

Approach 1 ----- apt/yum installation
-------------------------------------

1. Confirm the targeted packages could be installed via apt-get(Ubuntu) and yum(Centos),
you can verify on your own environment first by commands
"apt-get install {targeted packages}" on Ubuntu and "yum install {targeted packages}" on Centos.

2. Create a new role folder ({newrole}) in the compass4nfv/deploy/adapters/ansible/roles/,
create a new folder named "vars" in the new role folder({newrole}),
and create a file named "main.yml" and add "---" at the head of this file.

3. If the targeted packages names are same in both Ubuntu and Centos, you just need edit main.yml.

Add the packages' names as following:

.. code-block:: bash

    packages_noarch:
       - {targeted packages1}
       - {targeted packages2}
       - {targeted packages3}
       ...

4. If the targeted packages' names are different in Ubuntu and Centos,
you need create "Debian.yml" and/or "RedHat.yml" in the same folder as "main.yml" and add "---" at the head of the files.

Add the packages' names as following in the "Debian.yml" and/or "RedHat.yml" :

.. code-block:: bash

     ---
     packages:
        - {targeted Ubuntu/RedHat packages1}
        - {targeted Ubuntu/RedHat packages2}
        - {targeted Ubuntu/RedHat packages3}
        ...

Also you can refer "compass4nfv/deploy/adapters/ansible/roles/glance/vars" as example.

5.1 Add the new role to ansible so that Compass4nfv will install the packages during the deployment :
"enter compass4nfv/deploy/adapters/ansible/openstack_juno/" and edit HA-ansible-multinodes.yml and/or single-controller.yml,
add {newrole} at an appropriate position, please be aware of that compass4nfv deploys the roles
in the order as list in HA-ansible-multinodes.yml/single-controller.yml, you can add a new section as the following::

     - hosts: all/controller/compute/ha
       remote_user: root
       sudo: True
       roles:
           - {newrole}

The first line "hosts" of the section means compass4nfv will deploy {newrole} on which baremetals/VMs,
"all" means it deploys on all baremetals/VMs, "controller" means it deploys on all controller and so on.

Also you can refer "glance" position in HA-ansible-multinodes.yml and single-controller.yml.

Attention
    "HA-ansible-multinodes.yml" deploys controllers backup targeted environment
and 3 controllers in backup mode + 2 compute by default;.
    "single-controller.yml" deploys 1 controller + 4 compute.


5.2 Or insert the new role into the existing section at an appropriate position in
HA-ansible-multinodes.yml and single-controller.yml.

    Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    - hosts: controller/all/compute/ha
      remote_user: root
      sudo: True
      roles:
        - database
        - mq
        - keystone
        - nova-controller
        - neutron-controller
        - {newrole}

Please pay attention to the first line "hosts" by which Compass4nfv deploys {newrole} on which baremetals/VMs.

Also please pay attention to the position inserted as Compass4nfv deploys the packages in the order as list.

Also you can refer "glance" position as example in HA-ansible-multinodes.yml and single-controller.yml.

6. Run compass4nfv/build/make_repo.sh.

7. After 6 finishs, please check "compass4nfv/work/repo/" folder,
if files as following exist in the folder, that means building packages successfully.

centos7-juno-ppa.tar.gz is OpenStack Juno version for Centos7.

trusty-juno-ppa.tar.gz is OpenStack Juno version for Ubuntu14.04.

trusty-kilo-ppa.tar.gz is OpenStack Kilo version for Ubuntu14.04.


8. Edit compass4nfv/build/build.conf, find CENTOS7_JUNO_PPA and TRUSTY_JUNO_PPA items,
modify these 2 items as local paths(if you just want deploy with one operating system, you just modify one item).

CENTOS7_JUNO_PPA is packages path for Centos, TRUSTY_JUNO_PPA is packages path for Ubuntu

.. code-block:: bash

    CENTOS7_JUNO_PPA=/compass4nfv/work/repo/centos7-juno-ppa.tar.gz

    TRUSTY_JUNO_PPA=/compass4nfv/work/repo/trusty-juno-ppa.tar.gz


9. Run compass4nfv/build.sh to build a new ISO, after finished, if there is a new ISO file compass.iso
in the "compass4nfv/work/building" folder, that means building iso successfully.

Approach 2 ---- source installation
-----------------------------------

This section indicates to install packages from source codes. If the targeted packages could not be
installed from apt-get and yum but from source codes, please refer this section.

1. Enter folder "compass4nfv/build/arch/Debian" or "compass4nfv/build/arch/RedHat" that depend on
operating system you want to install package, create a bash(.sh) file
which includes all the commands which install the packages from source codes.

   Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y build-essential fakeroot debhelper \
             autoconf automake bzip2 libssl-dev \
             openssl graphviz python-all procps \
             python-qt4 python-zopeinterface \
             python-twisted-conch libtool wget

    pushd .
    cd /tmp
    wget http://openvswitch.org/releases/openvswitch-2.3.1.tar.gz
    tar -zxvf openvswitch-2.3.1.tar.gz
    cd openvswitch-2.3.1
    DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS='parallel=8 nocheck' fakeroot debian/rules binary
    cd -
    cp -f *.deb /var/cache/apt/archives/
    popd

Please pay attention to the last second sentence, all the compiled packages need to be
copied to the "/var/cache/apt/archives/"(Ubuntu) folder, and for Centos, the folder is ... to be continued .

2. Add a new role so that Compass4nfv will install the packages during the deployment,
create a new role folder ({newrole}) in the "compass4nfv/deploy/adapters/ansible/roles/",
create a new folder named "vars" in the new role folder({newrole}),
and create a file named "main.yml" and add "---" at the head of this file.

3. If the packages' names are same in both Ubuntu and Centos, you just need edit main.yml.

Add the packages' names as following:

.. code-block:: bash

    packages_noarch:
       - {targeted packages1}
       - {targeted packages2}
       - {targeted packages3}
       ...


4. If the targeted packages' names are different in Ubuntu and Centos,
you need create "Debian.yml" and/or "RedHat.yml" in the same folder as "main.yml"
and add "---" at the head of the files.

Add the packages' names as following in the "Debian.yml" and/or "RedHat.yml" :

.. code-block:: bash

     packages:
        - {targeted Ubuntu/RedHat packages1}
        - {targeted Ubuntu/RedHat packages2}
        - {targeted Ubuntu/RedHat packages3}
        ...

Also you can refer "compass4nfv/deploy/adapters/ansible/roles/glance/vars" as example.

5.1 Enter "compass4nfv/deploy/adapters/ansible/openstack_juno/" and edit HA-ansible-multinodes.yml
and/or single-controller.yml, add {newrole} at an appropriate position, please be aware of that compass4nfv
deploys the roles in the order as list in HA-ansible-multinodes.yml/single-controller.yml,
you can add a new section as the following::

     - hosts: all/controller/compute/ha
       remote_user: root
       sudo: True
       roles:
           - {newrole}

The first line "hosts" of the section means compass4nfv will deploy {newrole} on which baremetals/VMs,
"all" means it deploys on all baremetals/VMs, "controller" means it deploys on all controller and so on.

Also you can refer "glance" position in HA-ansible-multinodes.yml and single-controller.yml.

Attention
    "HA-ansible-multinodes.yml" deploys controllers backup targeted environment and
3 controllers in backup mode + 2 compute by default.
    "single-controller.yml" deploys 1 controller + 4 compute.

5.2 Or insert the new role into the existing section at an appropriate position
in HA-ansible-multinodes.yml and single-controller.yml.

    Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    - hosts: controller
      remote_user: root
      sudo: True
      roles:
        - database
        - mq
        - keystone
        - nova-controller
        - neutron-controller
        - {newrole}

Please pay attention to the first line "hosts" by which Compass4nfv deploys {newrole} on which baremetals/VMs.

Also please pay attention to the position inserted as Compass4nfv deploys the packages in the order as list.

Also you can refer "glance" position as example in HA-ansible-multinodes.yml and single-controller.yml.

6. Run compass4nfv/build/make_repo.sh .

7. After 6 finishs, please check "compass4nfv/work/repo/" folder,
if files as following exist in the folder, that means building packages successfully.

centos7-juno-ppa.tar.gz is OpenStack Juno version for Centos7.

trusty-juno-ppa.tar.gz is OpenStack Juno version for Ubuntu14.04.

trusty-kilo-ppa.tar.gz is OpenStack Kilo version for Ubuntu14.04.

8. Edit compass4nfv/build/build.conf, find CENTOS7_JUNO_PPA and TRUSTY_JUNO_PPA items,
modify these 2 items as local paths(if you just want deploy with one operating system, you just modify one item).

CENTOS7_JUNO_PPA is packages path for Centos, TRUSTY_JUNO_PPA is packages path for Ubuntu

.. code-block:: bash

    CENTOS7_JUNO_PPA=/compass4nfv/work/repo/centos7-juno-ppa.tar.gz

    TRUSTY_JUNO_PPA=/compass4nfv/work/repo/trusty-juno-ppa.tar.gz

9. Run compass4nfv/build.sh to build a new ISO, after finished, if there is a new ISO file compass.iso
in the "compass4nfv/work/building" folder, that means building ISO successfully.
