offline deploy
==============

If your Jumphost cannot access internet, compass4nfv also support offline
deployment. Here is the offline deployment instuction:

In a internet accessed environment:

1. Download compass.iso from OPNFV artifacts repository (Search compass4nfv in
http://artifacts.opnfv.org/ and download an appropriate ISO. ISO can also be
generated by script build.sh in compass4nfv root directory.)

2. Download the Jumphost preparation package from our httpserver. (Download
jh_env_package.tar.gz from `jh_env_package.tar.gz download page <https://205.177.226.237:9999/>`_.
It should be awared that currentlt we only support ubuntu trusty as a offline
Jumphost os.)

3. Clone the compass4nfv code repository.

On your offline Jumphost:

1. Copy the compass.iso, jh_env_package.tar.gz and the compass4nfv code
repository to your Jumphost.

2. Export the local path of the compass.iso and jh_env_package.tar.gz on
jumphost. Then you can perform deployment on a offline jumphost.

E.g.

Export the compass4nfv.iso and jh_env_package.tar.gz path

.. code-block:: bash

    # ISO_URL and JHPKG_URL should be absolute path
    export ISO_URL=file:///home/compass/compass4nfv.iso
    export JHPKG_URL=file:///home/compass/jh_env_package.tar.gz

Run deploy.sh

.. code-block:: bash

    ./deploy.sh
