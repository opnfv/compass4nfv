      "message": "The docks section should be deployed in the same node (suggest kube_master) with controllers so that they can share the same etcd cluster. Besides, you should only deploy one kube_master node or else controller and dock would be confused with each other.\n\nBesides inside `site.yml` under stor4nfv repo, I didn\u0027t specify the relationship between roles and hosts, so your suggestions are greatly required to fix the gaps, Thanks!",
